# Hi there, I'm David Amebley 👋

- 🌍 I am volunteering at Hack Junction, Finland, as a full-stack developer.
- 🎓 My background is in Computer Science and Information Technology.
- 💻 I enjoy working on backend services, frontend, and full-stack apps.
- 🌐 A strong focus on Java, Python, TypeScript, and C#.
- 🛠 Skilled in Test automation, and DevOps practices, including Bash scripting, Docker, and CI/CD with GitHub Actions.
- ☁️ Exploring cloud-first development, especially with AWS and Azure.
- <b>⚡ Fun fact:</b> I began as an I.T instructor teaching in a Ghanaian junior high school and earning multiple Best Teacher awards. This is where my love of programming was born, after innovating with tools such as MS Excel for tasks like exam result compilation and grade preparation.

<b>If you believe my skills could contribute to your mission, I'm eager to connect and explore how we can work together!<b/>
