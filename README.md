# Hi there, I'm David Amebley 👋

- 🌍 I am volunteering at Hack Junction, Finland, as a volunteer full-stack developer.
- 🎓 A background in Computer Science and a bachelor of science in I.T.
- 💻 I build backend, and full-stack software applications.
- 🌐 A strong focus on Java, TypeScript, C#, and Python.
- 🛠 Skilled in DevOps practices, including Bash scripting, Docker, and CI/CD with GitHub Actions.
- ☁️ Exploring cloud-first development, especially with AWS and Azure.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once taught IT in a Ghanaian junior high school and earned multiple Best Teacher awards. The leap into software development was inspired by my self-belief and encouragement from friends, especially after innovating with tools like MS Excel for tasks like exam result compilation and grade preparation.

If you're currently hiring, I would be happy to chat!
