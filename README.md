# Hi there, I'm David Amebley 👋

- 🌍 I am volunteering with Hack Junction, Finland, as a volunteer full-stack developer.
- 🎓 My background is in Computer Science and Information Technology.
- 💻 I enjoy working on full-stack, frontend, and backend services and apps.
- 🌐 A strong focus on Java, Python, TypeScript, and C#.
- 🛠 Skilled in Test automation, and DevOps practices, including Bash scripting, Docker, and CI/CD with GitHub Actions.
- ☁️ Exploring cloud-first development, especially with AWS and Azure.
- <b>⚡ Fun fact:</b> I once taught I.T. in a Ghanaian junior high school earning multiple Best Teacher awards. During this time, my love of programming was born, after innovating with tools like MS Excel for tasks including exam result compilation and grade preparation.

<b>If your team or company values growth, innovation, and collaboration, and you believe my skills could contribute to your mission, I'm eager to connect and explore how we can work together!<b/>
