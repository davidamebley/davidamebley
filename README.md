# Hi there, I'm David Amebley 👋

- 🌍 I am volunteering with Hack Junction, Finland, as a volunteer full-stack developer.
- 🎓 My background is in Computer Science and I.T.
- 💻 I enjoy working on backend services, frontend, and full-stack apps.
- 🌐 A strong focus on Java, TypeScript, C#, and Python.
- 🛠 Skilled in DevOps practices, including Bash scripting, Docker, and CI/CD with GitHub Actions.
- ☁️ Exploring cloud-first development, especially with AWS and Azure.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once taught IT in a Ghanaian junior high school and earned multiple Best Teacher awards. The leap into software development was inspired by my self-belief and encouragement from friends, especially after innovating with tools like MS Excel for tasks like exam result compilation and grade preparation.

If your team or company values growth, innovation, and collaboration, and you believe my skills could contribute to your mission, I'm eager to connect and explore how we can work together!
